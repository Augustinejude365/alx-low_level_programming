0x1A. C - Hash tables - Wrotten by Jude Augustine.

Task 0 - Write a function that creates a hash table.

Task 1 - Write a hash function implementing the djb2 algorithm.

Task 2 - Write a function that gives you the index of a key.

Task 3 - Write a function that adds an element to the hash table.

Task 4 - Write a function that retrieves a value associated with a key.
Task 5 - Write a function that prints a hash table.

Task 6 - Write a function that deletes a hash table.

Advanced Task 7 - In PHP, hash tables are ordered. Waitâ€¦ WAT? How
is this even possible?

Definition: Hash tables are data structures that use a hash function
to map keys to indices, allowing efficient retrieval of values. They
provide constant-time average complexity for basic operations like
insertion, deletion, and lookup.
